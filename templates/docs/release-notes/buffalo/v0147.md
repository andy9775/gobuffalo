### Minimum Go Version

In Go `1.12` the Go team introduced a `go 1.x` directive for go.mod files. Unfortunately this does not work on versions of Go `<1.11.4`. Because of this issue if you are using a version less than `1.11.4` then it is recommended you update as soon as possible.

When Go `1.13` is released `1.11.x` will reach end of life for support of Buffalo projects.
